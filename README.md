The paper presents two methods for certifiable mapping. The Safe Flight Corridors approach is in the folder `safe_flight_corridors` and is a Julia-based repository. The Certified ESDFs approach is in the submodule `dasc_ros_nvblox` which contains our fork of the `isaac_ros_nvblox` repository. The latter also contains our fork of `nvblox`.
